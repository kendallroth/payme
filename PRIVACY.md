# Privacy Policy

Your privacy is actually important to us! For that reason, we do not collect any personal/private information! You won't have to worry about us disclosing personal information to any parties, as we simply do not collect it!

In addition to valuing privacy, we value your time and have shortened this privacy policy to what really matters:

> We see nothing, know nothing, store nothing!
